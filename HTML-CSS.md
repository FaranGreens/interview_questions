### What are some new things happening in the web?
```
WebAssembly: WebAssembly is a low-level virtual machine that allows web developers to write code in languages other than JavaScript, such as C, C++, or Rust, and run it on the web.

Progressive Web Apps: Progressive web apps are web applications that provide a native app-like experience on mobile and desktop devices, including the ability to work offline, push notifications, and home screen installation.

Web Components: Web components are a set of standards that allow developers to create their own custom HTML elements, which can then be reused across different web applications.

Serverless Computing: Serverless computing allows developers to build and run applications without having to worry about managing servers, infrastructure, or scaling. Instead, developers can focus on writing code that runs in the cloud.

Web3: Web3 is a term that refers to the decentralized web, powered by blockchain technology. It includes applications like decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized social networks.

WebAuthn: WebAuthn is a new web standard that provides an easy and secure way to authenticate users using biometric or security keys, eliminating the need for usernames and passwords.

WebGPU: WebGPU is a new web standard that provides a low-level graphics API for the web, allowing developers to create high-performance graphics and compute applications using the GPU.

### Why do coding standards matter? What are some patterns you follow?
Coding standards matter because they help ensure that code is consistent, readable, and maintainable. Consistent code is easier to understand, debug, and modify, making it more efficient to develop and maintain software.
some software design patterns that are commonly used by developers:

Singleton: A pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to a single instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

Factory: A pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

Observer: A pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

Decorator: A pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

MVC: A pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components: the Model, which represents the data and the business logic; the View, which displays the data to the user; and the Controller, which handles user input and updates the Model and the View accordingly.

Strategy: A pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.




### How do you go about managing responsive websites?
Plan your website: Before you start designing your website, it's important to plan out your content and the user experience you want to provide. Consider how users will navigate your site on different devices and screen sizes.

Use a responsive design framework: Use a responsive design framework such as Bootstrap, Foundation, or Material Design that provides pre-built components and styles that are optimized for different screen sizes. These frameworks can save you a lot of time and effort in designing and coding your site.

Use fluid layouts: Use fluid layouts that stretch or shrink to fit the available screen size. Avoid using fixed-width layouts that may not look good on smaller screens.

Optimize images and media: Optimize your images and other media files so that they load quickly on all devices. Use appropriate image sizes and compression to reduce file size without sacrificing quality.

Test your website on different devices: Test your website on different devices and screen sizes to ensure that it looks and works as intended. Use tools such as browser emulators or real devices to test your site.

Iterate and improve: Continuously monitor your website's performance and user feedback, and make changes as necessary to improve the user experience on different devices.

### What do you care about the most when you write software?
writing software that is functional, reliable, and maintainable. This means that the software should do what it's supposed to do, without crashing or producing incorrect results. It should also be easy to modify or update in the future as requirements change.
Correctness: The software should produce the correct results and behave as intended, even under unexpected or exceptional circumstances.

Performance: The software should be efficient and responsive, with minimal delays or waiting times.

Security: The software should be secure and protect user data from unauthorized access or attacks.
